# hmpsn.studio — Claude Code Rules

> This file is loaded at the start of every Claude Code session. Follow it before making changes.

---

## Project Overview

**hmpsn.studio** is an SEO/web analytics agency platform. React 19 + Vite 8 + TailwindCSS 4 + React Router DOM 7 (frontend), Express + TypeScript (backend), SQLite via better-sqlite3 (storage).

Integrations: Webflow, Google Search Console, GA4, SEMRush, Stripe, OpenAI (GPT-4.1), Anthropic (Claude for creative prose).

- **Routing** — React Router DOM 7. `src/routes.ts` defines `Page` + `ClientTab` types, `adminPath()` + `clientPath()` helpers. Admin: `/ws/:workspaceId/:tab?`, Client: `/client/:workspaceId/:tab?`.
- **API Client** — Typed fetch wrappers in `src/api/` (7 modules). No raw `fetch()` in components.
- **Shared Types** — `shared/types/` (11 modules) shared between client and server.
- **Storage** — SQLite (WAL mode, foreign keys ON) at `DATA_BASE/dashboard.db`. 21+ migrations in `server/db/migrations/`.
- **AI** — OpenAI via `server/openai-helpers.ts` (`callOpenAI`), Anthropic via `server/anthropic-helpers.ts` (`callAnthropic`) for creative prose.
- **Auth** — Dual: internal JWT (7-day, admin) + client JWT (24h, per-workspace). Turnstile CAPTCHA optional.
- **Payments** — Stripe Checkout (not Payment Intents). Config encrypted on disk (AES-256-GCM).
- **Validation** — Zod v3 via `server/middleware/validate.ts`. Import as `import { validate, z } from '../middleware/validate.js'`.
- **Data Fetching** — React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`) for ALL frontend data. 50+ hooks in `src/hooks/admin/` and `src/hooks/client/`.
- **Logging** — Pino structured JSON (`server/logger.ts`). `createLogger(module)` for child loggers.
- **Error Monitoring** — Sentry (server + frontend). Auto-tags `workspaceId`.
- **Monetization** — 3 tiers (Free/Growth/Premium), per-item content purchases, 14-day Growth trial, UX soft-gating via `<TierGate>`.

## Session Protocol

### Before writing code

1. **Check `data/roadmap.json`** — scan for `"status": "pending"` in current sprint. If user hasn't specified a task, suggest the next pending item.
2. **Check `FEATURE_AUDIT.md`** — understand what exists. Don't build something that already exists.
3. **If UI work** — read `BRAND_DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md` before writing any JSX.
4. **Cross-reference before building** — search the codebase to verify a component/endpoint/feature doesn't already exist.
5. **For multi-phase or cross-system features** — before writing any implementation code, generate feature-specific guardrails: (a) CLAUDE.md rules for reusable patterns this feature introduces, (b) a `.windsurf/rules/<feature>.md` reference doc for feature-specific contracts, and (c) per-phase acceptance checklists embedded in the implementation plan. Guardrails written after bugs are found cost 3× more than guardrails written before the first commit.

### After completing a task

Every completed task must include:

1. **`FEATURE_AUDIT.md`** — add new entries or update existing ones for any feature work.
2. **`data/roadmap.json`** — mark completed items `"pending"` → `"done"`, add `"notes"`. Run `npx tsx scripts/sort-roadmap.ts`.
3. **`BRAND_DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md`** — update if any UI colors/components/patterns changed.
4. **Build verify** — `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck && npx vite build`
5. **Summarize** — what was done, what docs updated, what's next.
6. **`data/features.json`** — if the completed feature is client-impactful or sales-relevant, add/update its entry. Not every feature belongs here — only ones you'd mention on a sales call.

### Decision framework

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Clear, specific task | Proceed. Implement fully. |
| Ambiguous but low-risk (styling, docs) | Proceed with best judgment, explain. |
| Multiple directions (architecture, new feature) | Present 2-3 options with tradeoffs. |
| Conflicts with existing patterns | Flag conflict, recommend pattern-consistent approach. |
| Unsure if something exists | Search first, then proceed. |
| Pre-existing lint errors | Check Known Issues below. If listed, ignore. If new, fix only if caused by your changes. |

---

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server (frontend) |
| `npm run dev:server` | Express server (backend) |
| `npm run dev:all` | Both concurrently |
| `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` | Type-check |
| `npx vite build` | Production build |
| `npx vitest run` | Unit + integration + component tests |
| `npx playwright test` | E2E tests (requires server running) |
| `npx tsx scripts/sort-roadmap.ts` | Auto-archive completed sprints |

**Always verify after changes:** `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck && npx vite build`

## Design System — The Three Laws of Color

1. **Teal for actions** — every CTA, toggle, active state, tier badge, interactive highlight
2. **Blue for data** — clicks, sessions, impressions, info badges, progress bars (read-only, never actionable)
3. **Purple for admin AI only** — `AdminChat.tsx` and `SeoAudit.tsx` "Flag for Client". Never in client-facing views.

### Color quick reference

```
Button / CTA / toggle?      → Teal (from-teal-600 to-emerald-600)
Data metric?                 → Blue (text-blue-400, bg-blue-500/10)
Admin AI feature?            → Purple (purple-400/purple-600)
Score (health/perf)?         → scoreColor() from ui/constants.ts
Status badge?                → green=success, amber=warning, red=error, orange=changes-requested, blue=info, teal=client-requested
Tier badge (client)?         → Teal (all tiers) or zinc (free)
```

### Forbidden

- **Never** use `violet`, `indigo`, or new hue families without explicit approval
- **Never** hand-roll card markup — use `<SectionCard>`
- **Never** hand-roll stat displays — use `<StatCard>` or `<CompactStatBar>`
- **Never** hard-code score colors — use `scoreColor()` / `scoreColorClass()`
- **Never** use purple in any client-facing component

### UI Primitives — always check before hand-rolling

`SectionCard`, `StatCard`, `CompactStatBar`, `PageHeader`, `MetricRing`, `MetricRingSvg`, `Badge`, `TabBar`, `DateRangeSelector`, `DataList`, `EmptyState`, `TierGate`, `TierBadge`, `AIContextIndicator`, `StatusBadge`, `Skeleton` — all from `src/components/ui/`.

---

## Data Flow Rules (mandatory)

1. **Broadcast after mutation** — every POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE that changes workspace data must call `broadcastToWorkspace()` with an appropriate event.
2. **Frontend must handle broadcasts** — every `useWebSocket` handler must invalidate relevant React Query caches.
3. **Delete operations** — always read data before delete (for activity log context).
4. **Activity logging** — all significant operations must call `addActivity()`.
5. **STUDIO_NAME constant** — use the constant from `server/constants.ts`, never hard-code "hmpsn.studio".
6. **Typed data contracts at boundaries** — when data flows between layers (backend → API → frontend, or between modules via JSON columns), define typed interfaces in `shared/types/` BEFORE implementing. Never use `Record<string, unknown>` for new data shapes. Specifically:
   - New DB JSON columns → define a typed interface, not `Record<string, unknown>`
   - New insight types → add to `InsightDataMap` in `shared/types/analytics.ts`
   - New filter/category values → use shared const objects (like `INSIGHT_FILTER_KEYS`), not string literals
   - Percentage vs decimal fields → add JSDoc: `/** Already a percentage (e.g., 6.3 for 6.3%). Do NOT multiply by 100. */`
   - Shared string enums between producer/consumer → single const object imported by both sides

## UI/UX Rules (mandatory)

1. **Always use shared primitives** from `src/components/ui/` before creating new components.
2. **Loading states** — use contextual messages ("Analyzing site health..." not "Loading..."). Use `<Skeleton>` for layout-preserving shimmer.
3. **Empty states** — always action-oriented with a CTA using `<EmptyState>`.
4. **Error handling** — wrap major sections in `<ErrorBoundary>`. Show empathetic messages with retry.
5. **Mobile-first** — responsive design, test at mobile breakpoints.
6. **Color coding** — follow the Three Laws strictly.
7. **Accessibility** — proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management.
8. **Progressive disclosure** — show summary first, details on demand.
9. **Extract shared interaction patterns** — when 2+ components implement the same user interaction (toggle logic, filter state, sort behavior), extract to a shared hook or utility. Don't let subagents independently re-implement the same logic — it drifts. Example: `useToggleSet(defaults, { min, max })` instead of 3 inline `useState<Set>` + toggle handlers.

## Code Conventions

- **TypeScript strict** — no `any` unless unavoidable
- **API error shape**: `{ error: string }` consistently
- **User-facing strings**: follow `.windsurf/workflows/ui-vocabulary.md` canonical labels
- **Route validation**: Zod schemas via `validate()` middleware, not hand-written checks
- **Frontend data**: all hooks use `useQuery`/`useMutation`. No hand-rolled `useState`+`useEffect`+fetch patterns. Query keys: `admin-*` / `client-*` prefixes.
- **Imports**: always at top of file, grouped with existing imports. Never add imports mid-file next to the code that uses them — this breaks the oxc parser used by vitest/vite and violates code conventions. When adding code to an existing file, check existing imports first (`grep -n '^import' <file>`).
- **DB patterns**: lazy prepared statements via `createStmtCache()`/`stmts()`, JSON columns as TEXT parsed at read boundary, `rowToX()` mappers, three-state booleans (0/1/NULL). Use `parseJsonSafe`/`parseJsonFallback` from `server/db/json-validation.ts` — never bare `JSON.parse` on DB columns. Never use local `let` variables inside functions for prepared statement caching — the `if (!stmt)` guard is useless on a local variable that's re-initialized every call.
- **Array validation from DB** — when Zod-validating a JSON array column, validate items individually (filter out bad items) rather than validating the whole array (which drops ALL items if any one fails). Use `parseJsonSafeArray(raw, itemSchema, context)` from `server/db/json-validation.ts`. See `server/approvals.ts` `rowToBatch` for the pattern.
- **Zod schema field names** — when writing Zod schemas for existing TypeScript interfaces, always cross-reference field names against the source interface in `shared/types/`. Zod won't flag name mismatches at compile time — a required field with a wrong name silently fails `safeParse` at runtime, returning the fallback instead of real data.
- **Schema vs stored shape** — DB column schemas must reflect what is actually stored, not the in-memory assembled object. If a write path deliberately omits a field (e.g. storing it in a separate table), that field must be `.optional()` in the Zod schema. A required field absent from the stored blob causes every `parseJsonSafe` call to silently return the empty fallback, destroying all real data. See `keywordStrategySchema.pageMap` as the canonical example.
- **Large edits**: break into multiple smaller edits if > 300 lines
- **Route removal checklist** — when removing or renaming a `Page` type value, update ALL of these in the same commit:
  1. `src/routes.ts` — remove from `Page` union type
  2. `src/App.tsx` — remove `renderContent()` case
  3. `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` — remove sidebar entry
  4. `src/components/layout/Breadcrumbs.tsx` — remove from `TAB_LABELS`
  5. `src/components/CommandPalette.tsx` — remove from `NAV_ITEMS`
  6. Grep for `adminPath(*, 'old-route')` — update any navigation targets
  7. Tests referencing the old route value
- **String literal renames** — when renaming a discriminator value used across the codebase (insight type, status enum, filter key), grep the entire repo for the old literal and update ALL references in one commit. Never split a rename across multiple tasks or PRs.
- **Test assertions on collections** — never assert `.every()` or `.some()` on a potentially empty array without first asserting `length > 0`. `[].every(fn)` returns `true` vacuously, hiding real failures. Pattern: `expect(arr.length).toBeGreaterThan(0); expect(arr.every(fn)).toBe(true);`
- **New insight type registration** — adding a value to `InsightType` requires all four of these in the same commit: (1) `InsightType` union in `shared/types/analytics.ts`, (2) typed `XData` interface + `InsightDataMap` entry — never `Record<string,unknown>`, (3) Zod schema in `server/schemas/`, (4) frontend renderer case. Missing any one fails silently. See `.windsurf/rules/analytics-insights.md`.
- **DB column + mapper lockstep** — adding columns to any table requires migration SQL, row interface, `rowToX()` mapper, and write path (`upsertX()`) in the same commit. TypeScript will not catch a mapper that silently ignores a new column.
- **Enrichment field fallbacks** — optional fields computed at insight-store time must have explicit fallbacks. `pageTitle` must always resolve to something (cleaned slug if all else fails) — never render a raw URL. Enrichment failure must degrade gracefully, not block insight storage.
- **Feedback loop completeness** — every cross-system write (e.g. insights → strategy, insights → pipeline) requires both halves: server `broadcastToWorkspace()` AND frontend `useWebSocket` handler that invalidates the correct React Query key. Neither half alone is sufficient.
- **Client vs admin insight framing** — client-facing insight components must use narrative, outcome-oriented language. No purple. No admin jargon. Premium features wrapped in `<TierGate>`. Verify with `grep -r "purple-" src/components/client/` before marking Phase 3 done.

## Known Issues to Ignore

These pre-existing lint warnings are not caused by current work:

- **`ClientDashboard.tsx`**: `requestingTopic` declared but never read; `useEffect` missing dependencies (intentional fire-once)
- **`ContentPipeline.tsx`**: `useEffect` with `fetchSummary` callback dependency

Do not fix during unrelated tasks.

## Parallel Agent Coordination (mandatory before dispatching subagents)

Subagents are fully isolated — no shared state, no awareness of each other. Conflicts happen when two agents touch the same file or depend on output the other hasn't committed yet. Follow this protocol every time:

### 1. Pre-commit shared contracts first
Before any parallel agents start, identify every type, interface, or function signature that multiple agents will depend on. Define and **commit** these to the branch. Agents read from committed code, not from each other's in-progress work.

Examples of shared contracts: new entries in `shared/types/`, new exports in barrel files (`src/hooks/admin/index.ts`), new query keys in `src/lib/queryKeys.ts`, new DB store functions that multiple routes will call.

### 2. Assign exclusive file ownership
Each agent task description must include:
- **Owns** — exhaustive list of files it may create or modify
- **Must not touch** — any file owned by another parallel agent

If a file needs changes from more than one agent, it becomes a **sequential task** instead. No exceptions.

### 3. Shared files are sequential
Files commonly needed by multiple agents — route files, `analytics-insights-store.ts`, `shared/types/analytics.ts`, barrel exports — should be handled by one agent (or the orchestrator) after parallel work completes.

### 4. Diff review checkpoint after each parallel batch
After parallel agents finish, run:
```bash
git diff HEAD -- <list of shared files touched>
```
Check for: duplicate imports, conflicting function definitions, missed exports, mismatched type names. Fix before starting the next batch.

## Quality Gates

Work is not done until ALL pass:

- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` — zero errors
- [ ] `npx vite build` — builds successfully
- [ ] `npx vitest run` — full test suite passes (not just new tests)
- [ ] `FEATURE_AUDIT.md` updated (if feature work)
- [ ] `data/roadmap.json` updated (if roadmap item)
- [ ] `BRAND_DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md` updated (if UI changed)
- [ ] No `violet` or `indigo` in `src/components/`
- [ ] If subagents were used: review `git diff` for duplicate imports, conflicting edits, missed patterns
